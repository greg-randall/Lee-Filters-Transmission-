# Lee-Filters-Transmission-Data

The Lee Filters website has embedded SVGs that have a tooltip showing the color wavelength and transmission as a percentage. 

This CSV collects that data in one place so you can more easily design filter combinations. For the below screenshot, I'm comparing Egg Yolk Yellow and Moss Green.
